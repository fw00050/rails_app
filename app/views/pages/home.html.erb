<h2>Information and Learning</h2>
<p>

Most of us are now aware of the pressures placed on our wildlife by development in the modern world. Recently we have seen a proliferation of legislation, introduced by both the UK Government and the EU, designed to protect our biodiversity and safeguard our countryside. 
</p>

<p>
This part of the website will introduce some of the ways the BRC can support local societies, schools and individuals who want to begin recording or learn new skills to help them improve their recording. It will also provide you with some background information and highlight some aspects of Kent's communities and environments that we are involved in.

<h2>Enquiry service</h2>
<p>
<img src="assets/4.jpg" align="right">
The Surrey Biodiversity Information Centre provides a biodiversity </br>
enquiry service, also known as a data search.
</p>

<p>
For SBIC staff to undertake an enquiry on your behalf, you </br>
will need to fill out an information request form. This is </br>
downloadable as an interactive PDF. Please either email, fax </br>
or post the completed form to us with a map showing the </br>
area for which you require information. 
</p>

<p>
We endeavour to respond to your request within five working </br>
days of receiving your form, or for commercial enquiries </br>
within five working days of a fee being agreed. Please see </br>
our charging policy for details of this fee. 
</p>

<h2>How to get involved ?</h2>

<p>
Getting started with recording really only requires a pencil, paper, some patience and a willingness to learn. To put it very simply, recording is writing down what you see and where you saw it. 
</p>

<p>
However, in order to create a more useful record, and for us to be able to place the record into our database, we need a little more information than this (but not much).</br>
Thus you need to use the feature of <a href="../records/new">submit</a> to fill the essential information and submit it to our database!</br>
</p>

<p>Also, you can <a href="../contact">contact</a> us through email to attach the sighting.
